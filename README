In addition to the commands listed on the project spec, two additional 
commands have been added:

M <arg>
    changes the viewing mode
    arg can be any of: point wire solid lit
    ex: M point

N <arg>
    toggles normal visibility for arg-type normals
    arg can be either of: face vertex
    ex: N face

To input commands, focus on the glut window and press the 'c' key
Commands can then be entered into the terminal used to launch the program

Note that the orbit camera suffers from gimbal lock, so moving it to extreme 
y values will result in buggy behavior.

Also note that there is next to no error checking or input sanitation.
If the program is used properly (ie arg counts and types are correct for each
command) then there should be no problem.
