Tested + working on Skipper.

Things that were not implemented:
    - Light Nodes
    - Camera controls (camera node can only be moved by moving its transform 
      node)
    - Motions
    - Global rendering mode (point, wire, normals, etc)

I tried to make the UI as intuitive as possible, but here's a brief rundown 
in case I failed:

== The right subwindow ========================================================

__Selected Node Panel________________

This panel shows the name of the currently selected node, as well as a button
which changes the current selected node to the current node's parent (if its
parent exists)


__Children Panel_____________________

The dropdown box shows the names of all the children of the current node.
Note that only transform and object nodes can have children.
Clicking the "Select Child" button changes the currently selected node to
the node selected in the dropdown box. Clicking the "Delete Child"
button deletes the node selected in the dropdown box.

There is an unnamed panel below this (consider it a subpanel of the children
panel) that allows you to add a child node to the currently selected node
if it is allowed to have children. The dropdown box on the left selects the
type of node to add as a child of the current node.


__Geometry Node Panel________________

This panel is deactivated unless the currently selected node is an object
node AND that object node has a geometry node child.

The text box can be used to enter a file path of a .obj file, which can then
be loaded using the "Load File" button. The geometry node child can be deleted
using the "Delete Node" button.


__Attribute Node Panel_______________

This panel is deactivated unless the currently selected node is an object
node AND that object node has an attribute node child.

The dropdown menu selects the render mode of the parent object node. The
checkboxes are self explanatory. None of these options have any effect unless
the parent object node also has a geometry node child with a loaded .obj file.


__Camera Node Panel__________________

This panel is deactivated unless the currently selected node is a camera node.

The spinner options should be self-explanatory and all affect the perspective
matrix.


== Bottom Subwindow ===========================================================

This subwindow is deactivated unless the currently selected node is a transform
node.

Click and drag the rotate and translate widgets to move the transform node.
Scaling can likewise be set by using the spinners to the right. Clicking
the "Reset" button resets the current transform.
